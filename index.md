I'm a 5th year PhD student in [Macromolecular Science and Engineering](https://macro.engin.umich.edu/) and [Scientific Computing](https://micde.umich.edu/ph-d-in-scientific-computing/) at the University of Michigan.

I'm also a committer for the data management framework [signac](https://signac.io).
